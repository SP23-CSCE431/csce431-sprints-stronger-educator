# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# Implemented (if not, uncomment and run 'rails db:seed')

# District.create(id: 1, name: "Test District")
# District.create(id: 24, name: "Test District 24")
# Campus.create(id: 1, name: "Test Campus", district_id: 1)
# User.create(id: 1, name: "Test User", email: "test@email", campus_id: 1, district_id: 1)
District.create(id: 0, name: "No District")
